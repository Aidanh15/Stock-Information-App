# Stock-Information-App
A Simple web app hosted on an AWS EC2 instance using the Streamlit.py Python library, as well as a couple of Data science libraries. It displays information about a stock based on inputted ticker information. the default value is Amazon -->  'AMZN' It can be viewed at: http://52.212.210.130:8501/ (Yes I am refusing to buy a domain name).

Make sure to install any import dependencies with 'pip3 install import_name' if trying to run locally.
